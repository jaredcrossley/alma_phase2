--ALMA Phase 2 Scripts--

#########################
##make_summary_table.py##
#########################

This script is meant to read in an AOT file that has been prepared by a member
of P2G and output a table summarizing the SB setup of the project. This is
accomplished by internally unzipping the AOT file (it's really an archive),
reading the constituent SchedBlock and ObsProject XML files, parsing the
information of interest, printing that information in a pleasant format to the
terminal and deleting the unzipped contents of the AOT file. The AOT file is
**NOT** modified in any way.

A current (as of October 23, 2014) drawback of this script is that it is simply
my (nbrunett) reverse engineering of the XML files. While I have received some
advice from Alan Bridger this sometimes results in the SPW center frequencies
being different from those displayed in the OT GUI by ~10 MHz.

##QUICK START: make_summary_table##
###################################

To use this script, find the path to the AOT file you wish to generate a table
from and run Python on this script.

Example 1: AOT file is in the current directory and called
           "2013.1.00114.S_v1.aot"

  >python make_summary_table.py
  Enter path to aot file ("Q" to quit)
  ==>2013.1.00114.S_v1.aot
  
Example 2: AOT file is in /export/data_1/nbrunett/downloads/ directory

  >python make_summary_table.py
  Enter path to aot file ("Q" to quit)
  ==>/export/data_1/nbrunett/downloads/2013.1.00114.S_v1.aot
  
Example 3: AOT file is in another directory called "stuff" in the parent
           directory of current directory
           
  >python make_summary_table.py
  Enter path to aot file ("Q" to quit)
  ==>../stuff/2013.1.00114.S_v1.aot
  
Examole 4: AOT path can be specified in the call to Python as well

  >python make_summary_table.py ../stuff/2013.1.00114.S_v1.aot
